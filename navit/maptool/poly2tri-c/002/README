========================================================================

Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to compile the library, you need the GLib development files.
Then simply run ./configure, make and make install. More detailed
instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.

Direct Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to specify the outline points, create a file with the following
format:

P pt1_x pt1_y
P pt2_x pt2_y
P pt3_x pt3_y
...

To specify a hole, start the line with H instead of P. All the points
from that line and onward will belong to a hole. Each line begining with
H will create a new hole. To specify a steiner point, start the line
with S.

A simple invocation would look like this:

    p2tc -i mypoints.pts -o mymesh -s -m [-r N]

Explanation:

  -i Specifies the input file
  -o Specifies the base name for output files
  -s Would create an SVG output of the fine mesh as mymesh.svg
  -m Would create a PPM (raster) output of the fine mesh as mymesh.ppm
  -r N Specifies that at most N points shold be inserted to the mesh in
       the refinement step. Invocation without this argument lets the
       algorithm run until it converges.

API Usage
~~~~~~~~~
The source code for the p2tc program is shipped inside the bin/
directory. It should get you started very fast.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~
Like all software, this library has some limitations:

 - There nustn't be any repetitions of points (it also means that the
   first point shouldn't be repeated at the end of the file)
 - The outline mustn't be self-intersecting
 - All holes must lie inside the main outline and must not intersect in
   pairs
 - Nearly no input validation is done in order to speed up the
   computation. This means you may get strange crashes on incorrect
   usage. The most common such crashes are when specifying an input
   outline or hole with either the last point repeating the first, or
   with less than 3 input points.
