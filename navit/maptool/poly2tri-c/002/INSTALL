=============== Poly2Tri-C Installation Instructions ===================
========================================================================

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to compile the library you should have at least the following:

  - A working linux-like environment and tools, with the GNU C Compiler
    (gcc).

      - On Linux simply install gcc if it's not already installed, the
        rest is probably already shipped with your distribution,

      - On Windows you can install MSYS + MinGW from http://mingw.org,
        and this should provide you with all the needed tools

  - The development libraries and headers for GLib. You can get them
    from http://www.gtk.org.

Compiling from a source (tarball) distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once all prerequisites are satisfied, open a shell window and enter
the folder containing this distribution. You can now build this package
like any other GNU package by executing the following steps:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Compiling from a source tree snapshot (a Git checkout)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The steps are pretty similary, only that now you will also need to be
able to generate the configure script. For that you will need to install
the GNU autotools (autoconf, automake, etc.) and the GNU libtool.

Once all set up, simply run the ./autogen.sh script with the same
arguments you would pass to the ./configure script. Then proceed like
a regular build to make and make install.

Customizing the build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can customize the build result by supplying the ./configure script
with one or more of the following arguments:

  --enable-debug
    Enables generation of debugging information inside the built
    binaries. Useful if you wish to debug programs using the library or
    the library itself

  --enable-cdt-validation
    Forces the library to validate the triangulations it refines to
    check that they remain Constrained Delaunay. This adds a massive
    overhead and is not to be used by anyone other than people
    experimenting with the internal library algorithms!
